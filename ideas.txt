-Use get requests to send field information
--Might want to use posts to avoid url length
-Server can keep state info in a redis server, or SQL, doesn't matter.

###Beginning board creation
-Since it's an 8x8 grid, simply have 64 numbers in a row,
every 8 being a whole row. 0 for water, 1 for ship, 2 for hit, 3 for miss
-Use names like grid=hugeNumber, playerNum=number, gameNum=number
-Just random generate game numbers, just use max size of int. (could change this to random strings for less collisions)

###Polling
-Every second each client will make a request to server with gameNum=game_num and
playerNum=player_num . The server will respond with their board filled out and the opponents board
with the current hits and misses, and whose turn it is.
-Once it's a clients turn, they stop polling and make a move. Once the move has been made, they
begin polling again.
###Shooting
-Make a get request with gameNum=game_num, playerNum=player_num, x=X_coord, y=Y_coord.
Server responds with hit or miss
